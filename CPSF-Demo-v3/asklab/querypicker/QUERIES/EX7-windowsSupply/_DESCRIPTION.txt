* Scenarios
- 500 windows of quality 2 are shipped and received in good condition between time t1 and time t2

- 500 windows of quality 2 are shipped. 10% of the windows arrive broken and must be replaced. Same-quality windows are available for a replacement.
Solution: seller ships an additional 50 windows of quality 2

- 500 windows of quality 2 are shipped. 10% of the windows arrive broken and must be replaced. Same-quality windows not available. Higher-quality windows and non-environmentally friendly windows available for a replacement.
Solution: seller ships an additional 50 windows of quality 3
Note: quality 3 windows ensure that solar_panel_requirement is still satisfied
