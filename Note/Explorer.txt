# Purpose of this document is to discover and extend the Idea for Problems and Issues of CPS System --- Which should be extended for Reasoning about Trustworthinesss in Cyber-Physical System paper

# Issue 1: Improve the relation between Component and original CPS Ontology --> supplymentary properties 
    - Design new concept of CPS : Requirement OR Supplymentary Property (SP).
    - SP will supportFor a Property p in CPS. For example, ActiveAuthenticaion is a property which address for concenr Authentication. (Finger_printing_auth and two_factors_auth) are 2 SPs support for property ActiveAuthentication. The ActiveAuthenticaion is Satisfied Iff sat(Finger_printing_auth) OR sat(two_factors_auth)
    - Design new relation between a component c in C to a set of Supplymentary Proerties sp in SP. ==> denote relate(c,sp).
    - Assume that, there is a problem in CPS and make two_factors_auth is FALSE (unsat(two_factors_auth)). The mitigation action is not only able to turnOn/Off the two_factors_auth Supplymentary proerty, but also is able to switch the authentication function FROM two_factors_auth TO Finger_printing_auth. 
    - Generate the more powerful mitigation strategies (multiple types of actions which changes status of Supplymentary properties AND changes the relation between component and Supplymentary properties).
    - Allow composition from independent --- changing situations

# Issue 2: Combination of IT and OT alongs associated with Timing Constraints
    - 

# Issue 3: Emergent Behaviors and Effects: 
    - 

# Issue 4: The composition of concerns : C1*C2(CPS) = C1(CPS) U C2(CPS)
    - Example: "Timing Security" --> The composition of timing and security results in the collection of all the properties of CPS that are required by the "timing" and "security" concerns. ===> Resolving "conflicts" between properties is ONE of the Tasks of "requirement analysis"
