% Input device 1 can operate one of slow-mode or fast-mode.
% The SAM determines the mode of operation of input device 1.
% Normally, input device 1 reads inputs with a consistent frequency.
% If the basic type of input device 1 is configured to use encrypted memory and fast-mode, the the device will be unable to maintain a consistent frequency of reading.
