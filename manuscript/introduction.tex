\item Cyber-physical systems (CPS) combine cyber capabilities (computation and/or communication) with physical capabilities (motion or other physical processes).
 
\item Cars, aircraft,
and robots are prime examples, because they move physically in space in a way that is determined by discrete computerized control algorithms

\item CPS framework provides the taxonomy and methodology for designing, building, and assuring cyber-physical systems that meet the expectations and concerns of system stakeholders.

\item Ontology reasoning: Answer Set Programming
