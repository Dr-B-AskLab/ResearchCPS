% This file uses a simple tag-based language to define content for the query panel
% Character "%" introduces a single-line comment
% A tag defines an entry in the query panel
% The parameters of the tag follow the tag, one per line
% Leading and trailing blanks surrounding tags are ignored
%
% Tag: <blank line>
% ignored

% Tag: *LBL
% Next line: text of the label, HTML formatted
%
% Tag: *QUERY
% Next line: title of the query
% Next line: directory where the query-specific files are (others are assumed to be in dir "BASE")
% Next line: solver to be used; choose between (remove quotes) "dlv", "dlv (all models)", "clingo", "clingo (all models)"
% Next line: file with the ASP code for the query, to be located in the dir from the previous line
